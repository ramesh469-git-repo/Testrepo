<h1 id="supplemental-terms-for-trial-services">SUPPLEMENTAL TERMS FOR TRIAL SERVICES</h1>
<p>These terms supplement the applicable terms of the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/subscription-agreement/">Microsoft Online Subscription Agreement</a> (the “Agreement”) and any terms referenced therein that govern your use of the Trial Service. For the purposes of these Supplemental Terms for Trial Services (“the <strong>Supplemental Terms</strong>”), any trial of a commercially-available Online Service that links to these Supplemental Terms will be referred to as a “<strong>Trial Service</strong>”.</p>
<p>All terms used but not defined will have the same meanings as in the Agreement. Any additional legal terms that apply to your use of a specific Trial Service (“Specific Terms”) are set forth below. If a Trial Service links to these Supplemental Terms but it is not listed below, then that Trial Service does not have any Specific Terms.</p>
<p>For the avoidance of doubt, different Specific Terms may be applicable to you or your personnel at different times, and multiple Specific Terms may be applicable at one time, all depending on which trial periods are in effect for which Trial Services at any given time.</p>

<p><strong>1. Trial Period.</strong> Except for Dynamics 365 for Marketing, which only allows one trial per customer organization, there may be up to five concurrent trials of the Trial Service at any given time for your organization (each, a “<strong>Trial Instance</strong>”), and each such Trial Instance will remain accessible for a 30-day period beginning on the date when the first user of a given Trial Instance is first given access to it (“<strong>Trial Instance Effective Date</strong>”) until the date that is 30 days after such date (each, a “<strong>Trial Period</strong>”). Any given user in your organization who wants to gain access to this Trial Service may either create a new Trial Instance (if one is then available, subject to the foregoing limit on concurrent Trial Instances), in which case the Trial Period applicable to that user is 30 days, or that user may join any of the then-existing Trial Instances for your organization, in which case the Trial Period applicable to that user is the remainder of the 30-day period that began on the Trial Instance Effective Date for that Trial Instance. When the Trial Period for any given Trial Instance expires, that Trial Instance may be made available to you to export data in accordance with Section 5 below, after which that Trial Instance will be deleted, and you may create a new Trial Instance in its place (subject to the foregoing limit on concurrent Trial Instances).</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, Dynamics 365 Customer Service Insights allows unlimited trials per customer organization.</p>

<p><strong>3.

Microsoft will solely own any enhancements or improvements to the Trial Service arising from access to and use of Customer Data. Microsoft may also use information derived from Customer Data if such use does not include Customer Data and no Customer Data can be reverse engineered from such use.</p>
<p><strong>6. Compliance with Applicable Laws.</strong> You shall, as a condition of using the “Dynamics 365 for Marketing” online service, comply with all applicable laws and regulations governing your dissemination of any promotional materials through your use of the “Dynamics 365 for Marketing” online service. Microsoft bears no responsibility for your failure to comply with any such applicable laws or regulations.</p>
<p><strong>7. Defense of Claims &amp; Damages.</strong> You agree that you and/or your organization will defend Microsoft against all third party claims arising out of, or in connection with, <strong>(A)</strong> your use of the Trial Service in a manner that is prohibited by these Supplemental Terms, and/or, <strong>(B)</strong> any privacy violation alleged to have been committed or spam sent by you through your use of the Trial Service. You agree that Microsoft has the right to seek and recover all damages caused by you through your use the Trial Service for unlawful purposes, in an unlawful manner, or in a manner that violates Microsoft’s acceptable use, and/or anti-spam policies.
