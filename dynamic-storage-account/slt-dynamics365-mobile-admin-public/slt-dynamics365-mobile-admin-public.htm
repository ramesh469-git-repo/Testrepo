<p>By accessing or using the Dynamics 365 Product Insights services preview (together with any Microsoft provided data sources, the “Services”), you accept the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If you do not accept them, do not access or use the Services.

The terms and conditions of this agreement (“Agreement”) apply to your access and use of Services.</p>
<p><strong>1. WHAT THIS AGREEMENT COVERS</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.1 Definitions</strong></p>
<p>“Confidential Information” means non-public information, know-how, or trade secrets in any form that are designated confidential or that a reasonable person knows or reasonably should know to be confidential.

<p><strong>1.2 Application</strong></p>

<p><strong>1.3 Required Offerings</strong></p>
<p>Certain Microsoft services or software may be necessary to use the Services (“Required Offerings”). Microsoft does not grant any rights under this Agreement to access or use Required Offerings. Rather, Required Offerings are separately licensed under any respective Microsoft Licensing Agreement, and may require paying a fee. If you are a subscriber of Dynamics 365 or other Microsoft services, your MLA for Dynamics 365 customer agreement or other Microsoft service agreement applies to your use of Dynamics 365 or other Microsoft services generally. This Agreement applies to your use of the Services specifically.</p>
<p><strong>2. THE SERVICES</strong></p>
<p><strong>2.1. Pre-Release Services and Updates.</strong></p>

No additional rights (including without limitation implied licenses, rights or covenants) are granted by implication, estoppel or otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>4.2. No Claims of Ownership by Microsoft.</strong></p>
<p>Microsoft claims no ownership of or control over the Customer Data you provide to us in connection with your use of the Services. It is solely your responsibility to protect any rights you may have in the Customer Data and such information.</p>
<p><strong>4.3. Customer Data.</strong></p>
<p>You represent, and agree to ensure, that you have the necessary rights to any Customer Data, including Personal Data, software programs or services that you use in connection with the Services, and that such activities do not infringe or violate the intellectual property, personal or other proprietary rights of any third party. You agree to obtain all necessary rights, and comply with all licenses or other terms, from the rightful owner of such Customer Data, software programs or services that you do not own. You agree to access or use the Services (a) without purporting to subject Microsoft to any other obligations to you or any third party, and (b) solely in a manner that complies with all applicable laws and regulations.</p>
<p>Unless expressly noted, Customer will own any enrichments to the Customer Data. Unless the Services or documentation for the Services expressly prohibits doing so, Customer may export enriched data from the Services. Customer is solely responsible for ensuring that any system receiving such data complies with Customer’s legal obligations relating to that data.</p>
<p>Microsoft will solely own any enhancements or improvements to the Services arising from your access to and use of Customer Data and the Services. Microsoft may also use information derived from Customer Data if such use does not include Customer Data and no Customer Data can be reverse engineered from such use.</p>
<p><strong>4.4. Confidentiality.</strong></p>
<p>The Services, including their user interface, features, documentation, and output, are confidential and proprietary to Microsoft and its suppliers. This and all other information shared under this Agreement is Confidential Information subject to the nondisclosure agreement between you and Microsoft (“NDA”). In the event there is no existing NDA, or if such existing NDA is terminated or otherwise ceases to be in effect, then the remainder of this section applies. For 5 years after the date of disclosure, neither party will disclose the other’s Confidential Information to third parties. Each party may disclose the other’s Confidential Information only to its affiliates, employees, and contractors only on a need-to-know basis. Each party must have written agreements with them that protect the Confidential Information at least as much as this Agreement. Each party may disclose the other’s Confidential Information in response to a judicial or governmental order, but must first give written notice to the other party to allow it to seek a protective order or otherwise protect the information. Each party’s duty to protect the other’s Confidential Information survives expiration or termination of this Agreement.</p>
<p><strong>5. NO SUPPORT</strong></p>
<p>We have no obligation to provide any support services for the Services. The Services may be inaccessible due to scheduled and unscheduled reasons, including maintenance updates, power outages, system failures, extended downtime and other interruptions. During such periods, you may be unable to access or use all of, or a portion of, the Services. Some or all of the Customer Data may be lost. In the event of an outage or interruption that Microsoft determines may cause risk to the Services, Microsoft may determine in its sole discretion to suspend the Services.</p>
<p>FOR THESE REASONS, THE SERVICES ARE EXCLUDED FROM ANY COMMITMENTS MICROSOFT MAKES IN ITS SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS GENERALLY, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY COMMITMENTS MICROSOFT MAKES IN SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS APPLICABLE TO MICROSOFT POWER BI OR DYNAMICS 365.</p>
<p><strong>6. SOFTWARE</strong></p>

<p><strong>7. FEEDBACK</strong></p>
<p>If you give Feedback about the Services to Microsoft, you give to Microsoft, without charge, the right to use, share, and commercialize your Feedback in any way and for any purpose. You also give to third parties, without charge, any intellectual property rights needed for their products, technologies and services to use or interface with any specific parts of a Microsoft software or service that includes the Feedback. You will not give Feedback that is subject to a license that requires Microsoft to license its software or documentation to third parties because Microsoft includes your Feedback in them. These rights survive expiration or termination of this Agreement.</p>
<p><strong>8. PUBLICITY</strong></p>
<p>In connection with your access and use of the Services, Microsoft may create documentation, films, photographs, referrals, quotations, or other recordings or materials (“Publicity Materials”).

You will promptly review and either approve or disapprove them (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld) within 5 business days of receipt. Failure to respond within such 5-day period will be deemed approval. You are solely responsible for bringing to Microsoft’s attention any factual errors and for removing your Confidential Information from Publicity Materials.</p>

<p><strong>10. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</strong></p>
<p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL MICROSOFT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR THAT RELATE IN ANY WAY TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ITS PERFORMANCE. THIS EXCLUSION WILL APPLY REGARDLESS OF THE LEGAL THEORY UPON WHICH ANY CLAIM FOR SUCH DAMAGES IS BASED, WHETHER MICROSOFT HAD BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, WHETHER SUCH DAMAGES WERE REASONABLY FORESEEABLE, OR WHETHER APPLICATION OF THE EXCLUSION CAUSES ANY REMEDY TO FAIL OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. MICROSOFT’S TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT EXCEED U.S. $5.00. THIS CAP APPLIES WHETHER THE CLAIM IS IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE.</p>
<p><strong>11. TERM; TERMINATION</strong></p>

<p><strong>Exhibit A – Data Protection Terms</strong></p>
<p>Processing of Customer Data; Ownership</p>
<p>Customer Data will be used or otherwise Processed only to provide Customer the Services including purposes compatible with providing those services. Microsoft will not use or otherwise Process Customer Data or derive information from it for any advertising or similar commercial purposes. As between the parties, Customer retains all right, title and interest in and to Customer Data. Microsoft acquires no rights in Customer Data, other than the rights Customer grants to Microsoft to provide the Services to Customer. This paragraph does not affect Microsoft’s rights in software or services Microsoft licenses to Customer.</p>
<p>Disclosure of Customer Data</p>
<p>Microsoft will not disclose Customer Data outside of Microsoft or its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates except (1) as Customer directs, (2) as described in this Agreement, or (3) as required by law.</p>
<p>Microsoft will not disclose Customer Data to law enforcement unless required by law. If law enforcement contacts Microsoft with a demand for Customer Data, Microsoft will attempt to redirect the law enforcement agency to request that data directly from Customer. If compelled to disclose Customer Data to law enforcement, Microsoft will promptly notify Customer and provide a copy of the demand unless legally prohibited from doing so.</p>
<p>Upon receipt of any other third-party request for Customer Data, Microsoft will promptly notify Customer unless prohibited by law. Microsoft will reject the request unless required by law to comply. If the request is valid, Microsoft will attempt to redirect the third party to request the data directly from Customer.</p>
<p>Microsoft will not provide any third party: (a) direct, indirect, blanket or unfettered access to Customer Data; (b) platform encryption keys used to secure Customer Data or the ability to break such encryption; or (c) access to Customer Data if Microsoft is aware that the data is to be used for purposes other than those stated in the third party’s request.</p>
<p>In support of the above, Microsoft may provide Customer’s basic contact information to the third party.</p>
<p>Processing of Personal Data; GDPR</p>
<p>Personal Data provided to Microsoft by, or on behalf of, Customer through use of the Services is also Customer Data. Pseudonymized identifiers may also be generated through Customer’s use of the Services and are also Personal Data.</p>
<p>Processor and Controller Roles and Responsibilities</p>
<p>Customer and Microsoft agree that Customer is the Controller of Personal Data and Microsoft is the Processor of such data, except when Customer acts as a Processor of Personal Data, in which case Microsoft is a Subprocessor. Microsoft will Process Personal Data only on documented instructions from Customer. Customer agrees that this Agreement along with Customer’s use and configuration of features in the Services are Customer’s complete and final documented instructions to Microsoft for the Processing of Personal Data. In any instance where the GDPR applies and Customer is a Processor, Customer warrants to Microsoft that Customer’s instructions, including appointment of Microsoft as a Processor or Subprocessor, have been authorized by the relevant Controller.</p>
<p>Data Subject Rights; Assistance with Requests</p>
<p>Microsoft will make available to Customer in a manner consistent with the functionality of the Services and Microsoft’s role as a Processor Personal Data of data subjects and the ability to fulfill data subject requests to exercise their rights under the GDPR. Microsoft will comply with reasonable requests by Customer to assist with Customer’s response to such a data subject request. If Microsoft receives a request from Customer’s data subject to exercise one or more of its rights under the GDPR in connection with the Services, Microsoft will redirect the data subject to make its request directly to Customer. Customer will be responsible for responding to any such request including, where necessary, by using the functionality of the Services. Microsoft will comply with reasonable requests by Customer to assist with Customer’s response to such a data subject request.</p>
<p>Records of Processing Activities</p>
<p>Microsoft will maintain all records required by Article 30(2) of the GDPR and, to the extent applicable to the Processing of Personal Data on behalf of Customer, make them available to Customer upon request.</p>
<p>Data Security</p>
<p>Security Practices and Policies</p>
<p>Microsoft will implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect Customer Data and Personal Data. Those measures will be set forth in a Microsoft Security Policy. Microsoft will make that policy available to Customer, along with descriptions of the security controls in place for the Services and other information reasonably requested by Customer regarding Microsoft security practices and policies.</p>
<p>Customer Responsibilities</p>
<p>Customer is solely responsible for making an independent determination as to whether the technical and organizational measures for a Service meets Customer’s requirements, including any of its security obligations under the GDPR or other applicable data protection laws and regulations. Customer acknowledges and agrees that (taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation, and the nature, scope, context and purposes of the Processing of its Personal Data as well as the risks to individuals) the security practices and policies implemented and maintained by Microsoft provide a level of security appropriate to the risk with respect to its Personal Data. Customer is responsible for implementing and maintaining privacy protections and security measures for components that Customer provides or controls (such as devices enrolled with Microsoft Intune or within a Microsoft Azure customer’s virtual machine or application).</p>
<p>Auditing Compliance</p>
<p>Microsoft will conduct audits of the security of the computers, computing environment and physical data centers that it uses in Processing Customer Data and Personal Data, as follows:</p>
<p>• Where a standard or framework provides for audits, an audit of such control standard or framework will be initiated at least annually.</p>
<p>• Each audit will be performed according to the standards and rules of the regulatory or accreditation body for each applicable control standard or framework.</p>
<p>• Each audit will be performed by qualified, independent, third party security auditors at Microsoft’s selection and expense.</p>
<p>Each audit will result in the generation of an audit report (“Microsoft Audit Report”), which Microsoft will make available at https://servicetrust.microsoft.com/ or another location identified by Microsoft. The Microsoft Audit Report will be Microsoft’s Confidential Information and will clearly disclose any material findings by the auditor. Microsoft will promptly remediate issues raised in any Microsoft Audit Report to the satisfaction of the auditor.</p>
<p>If Customer requests, Microsoft will provide Customer with each Microsoft Audit Report. The Microsoft Audit Report will be subject to non-disclosure and distribution limitations of Microsoft and the auditor.</p>
<p>If Customer has entered into the Standard Contractual Clauses with Microsoft (as such Clauses are defined and included in Attachment 1 below), then Customer agrees to exercise its audit right by instructing Microsoft to execute the audit as described herein. If Customer desires to change this instruction, then Customer has the right to do so as set forth in the Standard Contractual Clauses, which change will be requested in writing.</p>
<p>If the Standard Contractual Clauses apply, then this section is in addition to Clause 5 paragraph f and Clause 12 paragraph 2 of the Standard Contractual Clauses.</p>
<p>Nothing in this section of the Agreement varies or modifies the Standard Contractual Clauses or affects any supervisory authority’s or data subject’s rights under the Standard Contractual Clauses or GDPR. Microsoft Corporation is an intended third-party beneficiary of this section.</p>
<p>Security Incident Notification</p>
<p>If Microsoft becomes aware of a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to Customer Data or Personal Data while Processed by Microsoft (each a “Security Incident”), Microsoft will promptly and without undue delay (1) notify Customer of the Security Incident; (2) investigate the Security Incident and provide Customer with detailed information about the Security Incident; (3) take reasonable steps to mitigate the effects and to minimize any damage resulting from the Security Incident.</p>
<p>Notification(s) of Security Incidents will be delivered to one or more of Customer’s administrators by any means Microsoft selects, including via email. It is Customer’s sole responsibility to ensure Customer’s administrators maintain accurate contact information on each applicable Services portal. Customer is solely responsible for complying with its obligations under incident notification laws applicable to Customer and fulfilling any third-party notification obligations related to any Security Incident.</p>
<p>Microsoft will make reasonable efforts to assist Customer in fulfilling Customer’s obligation under GDPR Article 33 or other applicable law or regulation to notify the relevant supervisory authority and data subjects about such Security Incident.</p>
<p>Microsoft’s obligation to report or respond to a Security Incident under this section is not an acknowledgement by Microsoft of any fault or liability with respect to the Security Incident.</p>
<p>Customer must notify Microsoft promptly about any possible misuse of its accounts or authentication credentials or any security incident related to the Services.</p>
<p>Data Transfers and Location</p>
<p>Data Transfers</p>
<p>Except as described elsewhere in this Agreement, Customer Data and Personal Data that Microsoft Processes on Customer’s behalf may be transferred to, and stored and Processed in, the United States or any other country in which Microsoft or its Subprocessors operate. Customer appoints Microsoft to perform any such transfer of Customer Data and Personal Data to any such country and to store and Process Customer Data and Personal Data to provide the Customer Services.</p>
<p>Microsoft will abide by the requirements of European Economic Area and Swiss data protection law regarding the collection, use, transfer, retention, and other Processing of Personal Data from the European Economic Area and Switzerland. All transfers of Personal Data to a third country or an international organization will be subject to appropriate safeguards as described in Article 46 of the GDPR and such transfers and safeguards will be documented according to Article 30(2) of the GDPR.</p>
<p>In addition, Microsoft is certified to the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks and the commitments they entail. Microsoft agrees to notify Customer in the event that it makes a determination that it can no longer meet its obligation to provide the same level of protection as is required by the Privacy Shield principles.</p>
<p>Data Retention and Deletion</p>
<p>At all times during the term of Customer’s subscription, Customer will have the ability to access, extract and delete Customer Data stored in the Services.</p>
<p>Except for free trials and LinkedIn services, Microsoft will retain Customer Data that remains stored in the Services in a limited function account for 90 days after expiration or termination of Customer’s subscription so that Customer may extract the data. After the 90-day retention period ends, Microsoft will disable Customer’s account and delete the Customer Data and Personal Data within an additional 90 days, unless Microsoft is permitted or required by applicable law to retain such data or authorized in this Agreement.</p>
<p>The Services may not support retention or extraction of software provided by Customer. Microsoft has no liability for the deletion of Customer Data or Personal Data as described in this section.</p>
<p>Processor Confidentiality Commitment</p>
<p>Microsoft will ensure that its personnel engaged in the Processing of Customer Data and Personal Data (i) will Process such data only on instructions from Customer, and (ii) will be obligated to maintain the confidentiality and security of such data even after their engagement ends.</p>
<p>Notice and Controls on use of Subprocessors</p>
<p>Microsoft may hire third parties to provide certain limited or ancillary services on its behalf. Customer consents to the engagement of these third parties and Microsoft Affiliates as Subprocessors. The above authorizations will constitute Customer’s prior written consent to the subcontracting by Microsoft of the processing of Customer Data and Personal Data if such consent is required under the Standard Contractual Clauses.</p>
<p>Microsoft is responsible for its Subprocessors’ compliance with Microsoft’s obligations in the Agreement. Microsoft makes available information about Subprocessors on a Microsoft website. When engaging any Subprocessor, Microsoft will ensure via a written contract that the Subprocessor may access and use Customer Data or Personal Data only to deliver the services Microsoft has retained them to provide and is prohibited from using Customer Data or Personal Data for any other purpose. Microsoft will ensure that Subprocessors are bound by written agreements that require them to provide at least the level of data protection required of Microsoft by this Agreement.</p>
<p>From time to time, Microsoft may engage new Subprocessors. Microsoft will give Customer notice (by updating the website and provide Customer with a mechanism to obtain notice of that update) of any new Subprocessor at least 14-days in advance of providing that Subprocessor with access to Customer Data or Personal Data.</p>

<p><strong>Attachment 1 to Exhibit A – The Standard Contractual Clauses (Processors)</strong></p>
<p>Beginning May 25, 2018 and thereafter, references to various Articles from the Directive 95/46/EC in the Standard Contractual Clauses below will be treated as references to the relevant and appropriate Articles in the GDPR.</p>
<p>For the purposes of Article 26(2) of Directive 95/46/EC for the transfer of personal data to processors established in third countries which do not ensure an adequate level of data protection, Customer (as data exporter) and Microsoft Corporation (as data importer), each a “party,” together “the parties,” have agreed on the following Contractual Clauses (the “Clauses” or “Standard Contractual Clauses”) in order to adduce adequate safeguards with respect to the protection of privacy and fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals for the transfer by the data exporter to the data importer of the personal data specified in Appendix 1.</p>
<p>Clause 1: Definitions</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>‘personal data’, ‘special categories of data’, ‘process/processing’, ‘controller’, ‘processor’, ‘data subject’ and ‘supervisory authority’ will have the same meaning as in Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data;</p></li>
<li><p>‘the data exporter’ means the controller who transfers the personal data;</p></li>
<li><p>‘the data importer’ means the processor who agrees to receive from the data exporter personal data intended for processing on his behalf after the transfer in accordance with his instructions and the terms of the Clauses and who is not subject to a third country’s system ensuring adequate protection within the meaning of Article 25(1) of Directive 95/46/EC;</p></li>
<li><p>‘the subprocessor’ means any processor engaged by the data importer or by any other subprocessor of the data importer who agrees to receive from the data importer or from any other subprocessor of the data importer personal data exclusively intended for processing activities to be carried out on behalf of the data exporter after the transfer in accordance with his instructions, the terms of the Clauses and the terms of the written subcontract;</p></li>
<li><p>‘the applicable data protection law’ means the legislation protecting the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals and, in particular, their right to privacy with respect to the processing of personal data applicable to a data controller in the Member State in which the data exporter is established;</p></li>
<li><p>‘technical and organisational security measures’ means those measures aimed at protecting personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access, in particular where the processing involves the transmission of data over a network, and against all other unlawful forms of processing.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Clause 2: Details of the transfer</p>
<p>The details of the transfer and in particular the special categories of personal data where applicable are specified in Appendix 1 below which forms an integral part of the Clauses.</p>
<p>Clause 3: Third-party beneficiary clause</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The data subject can enforce against the data exporter this Clause, Clause 4(b) to (i), Clause 5(a) to (e), and (g) to (j), Clause 6(1) and (2), Clause 7, Clause 8(2), and Clauses 9 to 12 as third-party beneficiary.</p></li>
<li><p>The data subject can enforce against the data importer this Clause, Clause 5(a) to (e) and (g), Clause 6, Clause 7, Clause 8(2), and Clauses 9 to 12, in cases where the data exporter has factually disappeared or has ceased to exist in law unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter by contract or by operation of law, as a result of which it takes on the rights and obligations of the data exporter, in which case the data subject can enforce them against such entity.</p></li>
<li><p>The data subject can enforce against the subprocessor this Clause, Clause 5(a) to (e) and (g), Clause 6, Clause 7, Clause 8(2), and Clauses 9 to 12, in cases where both the data exporter and the data importer have factually disappeared or ceased to exist in law or have become insolvent, unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter by contract or by operation of law as a result of which it takes on the rights and obligations of the data exporter, in which case the data subject can enforce them against such entity. Such third-party liability of the subprocessor will be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses.</p></li>
<li><p>The parties do not object to a data subject being represented by an association or other body if the data subject so expressly wishes and if permitted by national law.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Clause 4: Obligations of the data exporter</p>
<p>The data exporter agrees and warrants:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>that the processing, including the transfer itself, of the personal data has been and will continue to be carried out in accordance with the relevant provisions of the applicable data protection law (and, where applicable, has been notified to the relevant authorities of the Member State where the data exporter is established) and does not violate the relevant provisions of that State;</p></li>
<li><p>that it has instructed and throughout the duration of the personal data processing services will instruct the data importer to process the personal data transferred only on the data exporter’s behalf and in accordance with the applicable data protection law and the Clauses;</p></li>
<li><p>that the data importer will provide sufficient guarantees in respect of the technical and organisational security measures specified in Appendix 2 below;</p></li>
<li><p>that after assessment of the requirements of the applicable data protection law, the security measures are appropriate to protect personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access, in particular where the processing involves the transmission of data over a network, and against all other unlawful forms of processing, and that these measures ensure a level of security appropriate to the risks presented by the processing and the nature of the data to be protected having regard to the state of the art and the cost of their implementation;</p></li>
<li><p>that it will ensure compliance with the security measures;</p></li>
<li><p>that, if the transfer involves special categories of data, the data subject has been informed or will be informed before, or as soon as possible after, the transfer that its data could be transmitted to a third country not providing adequate protection within the meaning of Directive 95/46/EC;</p></li>
<li><p>to forward any notification received from the data importer or any subprocessor pursuant to Clause 5(b) and Clause 8(3) to the data protection supervisory authority if the data exporter decides to continue the transfer or to lift the suspension;</p></li>
<li><p>to make available to the data subjects upon request a copy of the Clauses, with the exception of Appendix 2, and a summary description of the security measures, as well as a copy of any contract for subprocessing services which has to be made in accordance with the Clauses, unless the Clauses or the contract contain commercial information, in which case it may remove such commercial information;</p></li>
<li><p>that, in the event of subprocessing, the processing activity is carried out in accordance with Clause 11 by a subprocessor providing at least the same level of protection for the personal data and the rights of data subject as the data importer under the Clauses; and</p></li>
<li><p>that it will ensure compliance with Clause 4(a) to (i).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Clause 5: Obligations of the data importer</p>
<p>The data importer agrees and warrants:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>to process the personal data only on behalf of the data exporter and in compliance with its instructions and the Clauses; if it cannot provide such compliance for whatever reasons, it agrees to inform promptly the data exporter of its inability to comply, in which case the data exporter is entitled to suspend the transfer of data and/or terminate the contract;</p></li>
<li><p>that it has no reason to believe that the legislation applicable to it prevents it from fulfilling the instructions received from the data exporter and its obligations under the contract and that in the event of a change in this legislation which is likely to have a substantial adverse effect on the warranties and obligations provided by the Clauses, it will promptly notify the change to the data exporter as soon as it is aware, in which case the data exporter is entitled to suspend the transfer of data and/or terminate the contract;</p></li>
<li><p>that it has implemented the technical and organisational security measures specified in Appendix 2 before processing the personal data transferred;</p></li>
<li><p>that it will promptly notify the data exporter about:</p></li>
<li><p>any legally binding request for disclosure of the personal data by a law enforcement authority unless otherwise prohibited, such as a prohibition under criminal law to preserve the confidentiality of a law enforcement investigation,</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="2" type="i">
<li><p>any accidental or unauthorised access, and</p></li>
<li><p>any request received directly from the data subjects without responding to that request, unless it has been otherwise authorised to do so;</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="5" type="a">
<li><p>to deal promptly and properly with all inquiries from the data exporter relating to its processing of the personal data subject to the transfer and to abide by the advice of the supervisory authority with regard to the processing of the data transferred;</p></li>
<li><p>at the request of the data exporter to submit its data processing facilities for audit of the processing activities covered by the Clauses which will be carried out by the data exporter or an inspection body composed of independent members and in possession of the required professional qualifications bound by a duty of confidentiality, selected by the data exporter, where applicable, in agreement with the supervisory authority;</p></li>
<li><p>to make available to the data subject upon request a copy of the Clauses, or any existing contract for subprocessing, unless the Clauses or contract contain commercial information, in which case it may remove such commercial information, with the exception of Appendix 2 which will be replaced by a summary description of the security measures in those cases where the data subject is unable to obtain a copy from the data exporter;</p></li>
<li><p>that, in the event of subprocessing, it has previously informed the data exporter and obtained its prior written consent;</p></li>
<li><p>that the processing services by the subprocessor will be carried out in accordance with Clause 11; and</p></li>
<li><p>to send promptly a copy of any subprocessor agreement it concludes under the Clauses to the data exporter.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Clause 6: Liability</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The parties agree that any data subject who has suffered damage as a result of any breach of the obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11 by any party or subprocessor is entitled to receive compensation from the data exporter for the damage suffered.</p></li>
<li><p>If a data subject is not able to bring a claim for compensation in accordance with paragraph 1 against the data exporter, arising out of a breach by the data importer or his subprocessor of any of their obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11, because the data exporter has factually disappeared or ceased to exist in law or has become insolvent, the data importer agrees that the data subject may issue a claim against the data importer as if it were the data exporter, unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter by contract of by operation of law, in which case the data subject can enforce its rights against such entity.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The data importer may not rely on a breach by a subprocessor of its obligations in order to avoid its own liabilities.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>If a data subject is not able to bring a claim against the data exporter or the data importer referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, arising out of a breach by the subprocessor of any of their obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11 because both the data exporter and the data importer have factually disappeared or ceased to exist in law or have become insolvent, the subprocessor agrees that the data subject may issue a claim against the data subprocessor with regard to its own processing operations under the Clauses as if it were the data exporter or the data importer, unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter or data importer by contract or by operation of law, in which case the data subject can enforce its rights against such entity. The liability of the subprocessor will be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses.</li>
</ol>
<p>Clause 7: Mediation and jurisdiction</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The data importer agrees that if the data subject invokes against it third-party beneficiary rights and/or claims compensation for damages under the Clauses, the data importer will accept the decision of the data subject:</li>
</ol>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>to refer the dispute to mediation, by an independent person or, where applicable, by the supervisory authority;</p></li>
<li><p>to refer the dispute to the courts in the Member State in which the data exporter is established.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>The parties agree that the choice made by the data subject will not prejudice its substantive or procedural rights to seek remedies in accordance with other provisions of national or international law.</li>
</ol>
<p>Clause 8: Cooperation with supervisory authorities</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The data exporter agrees to deposit a copy of this contract with the supervisory authority if it so requests or if such deposit is required under the applicable data protection law.</p></li>
<li><p>The parties agree that the supervisory authority has the right to conduct an audit of the data importer, and of any subprocessor, which has the same scope and is subject to the same conditions as would apply to an audit of the data exporter under the applicable data protection law.</p></li>
<li><p>The data importer will promptly inform the data exporter about the existence of legislation applicable to it or any subprocessor preventing the conduct of an audit of the data importer, or any subprocessor, pursuant to paragraph 2. In such a case the data exporter will be entitled to take the measures foreseen in Clause 5 (b).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Clause 9: Governing Law.</p>
<p>The Clauses will be governed by the law of the Member State in which the data exporter is established.</p>
<p>Clause 10: Variation of the contract</p>
<p>The parties undertake not to vary or modify the Clauses. This does not preclude the parties from adding clauses on business related issues where required as long as they do not contradict the Clause.</p>
<p>Clause 11: Subprocessing</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The data importer will not subcontract any of its processing operations performed on behalf of the data exporter under the Clauses without the prior written consent of the data exporter. Where the data importer subcontracts its obligations under the Clauses, with the consent of the data exporter, it will do so only by way of a written agreement with the subprocessor which imposes the same obligations on the subprocessor as are imposed on the data importer under the Clauses. Where the subprocessor fails to fulfil its data protection obligations under such written agreement the data importer will remain fully liable to the data exporter for the performance of the subprocessor’s obligations under such agreement.</p></li>
<li><p>The prior written contract between the data importer and the subprocessor will also provide for a third-party beneficiary clause as laid down in Clause 3 for cases where the data subject is not able to bring the claim for compensation referred to in paragraph 1 of Clause 6 against the data exporter or the data importer because they have factually disappeared or have ceased to exist in law or have become insolvent and no successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter or data importer by contract or by operation of law. Such third-party liability of the subprocessor will be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses.</p></li>
<li><p>The provisions relating to data protection aspects for subprocessing of the contract referred to in paragraph 1 will be governed by the law of the Member State in which the data exporter is established.</p></li>
<li><p>The data exporter will keep a list of subprocessing agreements concluded under the Clauses and notified by the data importer pursuant to Clause 5 (j), which will be updated at least once a year. The list will be available to the data exporter’s data protection supervisory authority.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Clause 12: Obligation after the termination of personal data processing services</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The parties agree that on the termination of the provision of data processing services, the data importer and the subprocessor will, at the choice of the data exporter, return all the personal data transferred and the copies thereof to the data exporter or will destroy all the personal data and certify to the data exporter that it has done so, unless legislation imposed upon the data importer prevents it from returning or destroying all or part of the personal data transferred. In that case, the data importer warrants that it will guarantee the confidentiality of the personal data transferred and will not actively process the personal data transferred anymore.</p></li>
<li><p>The data importer and the subprocessor warrant that upon request of the data exporter and/or of the supervisory authority, it will submit its data processing facilities for an audit of the measures referred to in paragraph 1.</p></li>
