<h1 id="supplemental-terms-for-microsoft-dynamics-customer-voice-trial">SUPPLEMENTAL TERMS FOR MICROSOFT DYNAMICS CUSTOMER VOICE TRIAL</h1>
<p>These terms supplement the applicable terms of your applicable volume licensing agreement (e.g., the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/subscription-agreement/">Microsoft Online Subscription Agreement</a>)(the “<strong>Agreement</strong>”) and any terms referenced therein that govern your use of the Trial Service. These Supplemental Terms for Microsoft Dynamics Customer Voice Trial (“the <strong>Supplemental Terms</strong>”), apply to the trial of the commercially-available version of Microsoft Dynamics Customer Voice (the “<strong>Trial Service</strong>”).</p>
<p>All terms used but not defined will have the same meanings as in the Agreement.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Trial Period</strong>. There may be unlimited trials of the Trial Service at any given time for your organization (each, a “<strong>Trial Instance</strong>”), and each such Trial Instance will remain accessible for a 30-day period beginning on the date when the first user of a given Trial Instance is first given access to it (“Trial Instance Effective Date”) until the date that is 30 days after such date (each, a “<strong>Trial Period</strong>”). Any given user in your organization who wants to gain access to this Trial Service may either create a new Trial Instance, in which case the Trial Period applicable to that user is 30 days, or that user may join any of the then-existing Trial Instances for your organization, in which case the Trial Period applicable to that user is the remainder of the Trial Period for that Trial Instance. When the Trial Period for any given Trial Instance expires, that Trial Instance may be made available to you to export data in accordance with Section 5 below, after which that Trial Instance will be deleted, and you may create a new Trial Instance in its place.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Termination</strong>.

You agree that Microsoft has the right to seek and recover all damages caused by you through your use the Trial Service for unlawful purposes, in an unlawful manner, or in a manner that violates Microsoft’s acceptable use, and/or anti-spam policies.
