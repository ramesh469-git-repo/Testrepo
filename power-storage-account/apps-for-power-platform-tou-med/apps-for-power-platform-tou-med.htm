<p>These terms of use are an agreement between you and the App Provider. Please read them. They apply to the add-in, connector, or other software application for use with Power Platform services that you download or install from AppSource or acquire from within the settings of Power Platform services (the “App”), including any updates or supplements for the App, unless the App comes with separate terms, in which case those terms apply.</p>
<p><strong>BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, OR USING THE APP, OR ATTEMPTING TO DO ANY OF THESE, YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THEM, YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO AND MUST NOT DOWNLOAD, INSTALL, OR USE THE APP.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Except for the above, if the App enables access to any Internet-based services, your use of those services will be subject to the separately-provided terms of use.</strong></p>
<p><strong>In this agreement “App Provider” means the entity licensing the App to you, as identified in AppSource or the App’s description. If the App is licensed to you by Microsoft, then the App Provider is Microsoft (or based on where you live, one of its affiliates).</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you comply with these terms of use, you have the rights below.</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS.</strong></p>
